# Proof of Concept with React as our server-side view renderer.

This not only renders server-side views, but lets components be used on front or back end.

---

`rails s`

Then visit `localhost:3000`

View source and see it's rendered HTML.

Click share. Notice how the events are automatically hooked up.

All components are at `app/assets/javascripts/components`
